	Devices don't have sources in this case; so what should I do?

	Medications don't seem to have ingredients in DSTU2. do I just remove everything corresponding to that? 

OmopPatient
	line 1014, genderCode might need to be null or "?" instead of ""

OmopConceptMapping
	line 39, Gender type NULL doesn't exist in DSTU2, 


For Medication: in DSTU2, the Ingredient is at a lower level (product backbone element)

for DeviceUseStatement:
	in STU3, it extends a DomainResource, but in DSTU2, we only extend "BaseResource"

OmopPractitioner:
	line 119, using fhirName as setName instead of fhirNameList
	line 306, setting ADMIN_OTHER as we don't have ADMIN_NULL 
	line 347, I'm just setting the family name as the practitioner name. Is that correct? 

OmopMedicationRequest
	line 624/625, is GetDateWritten equivalent to getAuthoredOn
